Improved Chat by wd1966
=======================

**Improved Chat** is a legacy mod developed by *wd1966* which was abandoned and went through several different maintainers who maintained the old (base-class-overriding) version before I get fed up with the conflicts this generated and decided to make a base clean litemod version.

A lot of the code here is still pretty dreadful (having been decompiled and recompiled multiple times) but I've done my best to clean it up in a basic fashion so that it's at least readable and not totally broken. However please bear in mind whilst browsing that this code is not even close to representative of anything I would write myself.

If you want to compile this then you'll need a LiteLoader MCP workspace but the ant script does the rest. If you're not using Eclipse or MCP then you're on your own.
